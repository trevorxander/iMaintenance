# iMaintenance
## Problem Definition
### The Previous System
The present system for maintenance involves keeping multiple hand written ledgers, when information is needed to be accessed for various purposes. A manual look up is in order frequently, to be reminded of periodic future maintenance. Receipts for these maintenance are filed in separately, identifiable by reference code noted down on the ledger.

### Forms Of Data
All data is handwritten into the ledgers.
All logs are maintained in writing by the client.

### Inefficiencies of The Present System
* Difficult access to data
* Has little to no access restrictions
* Data cannot be edited
* Searching through data is time consuming
* No way to sort the data
* Data cannot be collected from multiple sources

## Proposed Solution
Automated  solution is ideal for this situation. The programming language VB.net 2005 will be used for building this software. This software will be custom built to incorporate the specific requirements put forward by the client.

### Requirement Specification
1. Login page
2. Home 
   * Overview of logs
3. Logs
    * View logs
    * View all logs (Admin only)
    * Sort logs
    * Filter logs
    * Add new logs
    * Edit existing logs
4. Settings
    * Help
    * Change password
    * Change admin (Admin only)
    * Create a new user (Admin only)

### Technical Requirements
Hardware Requirements
 * Mouse
 * Keyboard
 * Display (800*600) or more

Minimum Requirement
 * Windows XP
 * 1GB RAM
 * 1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

Recommended 
 * Windows 7 Service Pack 2 or later
 * 2 GB RAM
 * 1.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
  
## Features
### Digital Data
* Data need not be maintained manually 
* Data can be easily manipulated
* Data can achieve a sorted view to accommodate user requirement
* Data can be filtered with ease
* Data can be copied or moved without displacing any physical object
* Data can be protected easily without the need of any physical container that restricts access

### User Interface
User friendly interface allows the use of software without the requirement of any technical knowledge
User interface is designed with control, conveyance and continuity in mind, so that the user never feels lost operating the software.

### Multi-User
Multiple users can add records to the database

### Access Privileges
Each user can only view and edit the logs they have added. On the other hand, the admin has access to all logs. Implementing such a system using ledgers, can be very challenging.


## Current Limitations
### Printing
There isn't a built in feature to output the data in a printer friendly format. This feature could be included in a later revision of this software.

### Backup and Archiving
No built in feature to backup or archive data is included with the current revision. This feature could be included in a later revision of this software.
